# LLM-based Maritime Collision Avoidance System

## Overview
An implementation of COLREGs-compliant collision avoidance for Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Large Language Models. The system leverages LLMs for situation assessment and decision-making while maintaining consistent COLREGs compliance through state-aware maneuver execution.

## Key Features
- LLM-based COLREGs interpretation and decision making
- Real-time collision avoidance for maritime encounters
- Fuzzy logic risk assessment integration
- State-aware maneuver management
- Explainable decision outputs

## System Architecture
- AI-based Decision Maker using ChatGPT API
- Prompt engineering for maritime scenarios
- Local planning and control integration
- Feedback loop for consistent behavior

## Encounter Types Handled
- Crossing situations (give-way and stand-on)
- Overtaking scenarios
- Head-on encounters

## Key Parameters
- Risk Assessment (ZMF based)
- DCPA (Distance at Closest Point of Approach)
- TCPA (Time to Closest Point of Approach)
- Relative bearing
- Range measurements
